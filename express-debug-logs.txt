(node:1138) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///home/runner/workspace/server.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /home/runner/workspace/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
